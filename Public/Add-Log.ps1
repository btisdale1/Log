	    Title:			Add-Log.ps1
	    Author:			Curtis Jones
	    Date:			March 24th, 2017
	    Version:		1.0.1
	    Requirements:		Powershell 3.0
	
    .SYNOPSIS
        Provides code execution string logging into $env:LOCALAPPDATA\PowerShellLogging directory along with the ability to output to all valid PowerShell streams simultaneously.
    .DESCRIPTION
        Add-Log provides a simple but effective way to simultaneously log all desired information to a standardized logging location within $env:LOCALAPPDATA\PowerShellLogging while also allowing simultaneous output to all valid PowerShell streams. This function works in conjunction with the Set-LogFile function to generate and maintain a healthy log file structure. This function is all that needs to be called to automatically generate a valid logging file and start using it.
    .PARAMETER Message

        The message that will be logged to the local log file and also output to PowerShell stream if the Out switch is used.
    .PARAMETER Type

        Used to indicate the type of log message and also used to correlate the type of stream to be utilized if the Out switch is used.
    .PARAMETER Out

        Used to output the log message to the corresponding message stream and also output to console.
    .PARAMETER LogFileSizeThreshold

        Provide a valid size for a log file threshold such as 1GB, 500MB, 1024KB, etc.
    .EXAMPLE
        Add-Log -Message "The reactor core has reached critical mass" -Type Warning -Out

        The above example would write the message string to the log file indicated by the path within the script scope $logFile variable generated by Set-LogFile and will also pass the message into the warning stream and output to the console.
