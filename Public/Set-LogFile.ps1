    .SYNOPSIS
        Provides log file generation in the $env:LOCALAPPDATA\PowerShellLogging folder based on input from the Add-Log function.
    .DESCRIPTION
        Set-LogFile provides an easy and effective way to create a new log file if necessary in the $env:LOCALAPPDATA\PowerShellLogging folder. If necessary the path and the file will be created and a file path string will be returned by the function for use by the Add-Log function. If the ShowLocation switch param is used the MessageBox show method will be used to display the location of the created file.
    .PARAMETER LogFileName

        Provide a simple name with no spaces such as < ScriptName >
    .PARAMETER ShowLocation

        Use switch to utilize the Forms.MessageBox method to display the log file name and location.
    .EXAMPLE
        Set-LogFile -LogFileName TestLogName -ShowLocation

        The example above will create the following log file/location, $env:LOCALAPPDATA\PowerShellLogging\TestLogName\TestLogName.log. The log file location will be displayed using the MessageBox show method.
